# FFmpegSR: A General Framework Torward Real-Time 4K Super-Resolution



### Overview
In this paper, we implement a framework, FFmpegSR, that applies deep learning based super resolution into an FFmpeg filter to implement real-time 4K super resolution. FFmpegSR applies super-resolution to Y channel only and develop a patch-based solution that uses saliency detection to select regions of interest on the video frame.

### Prerequist
FFmpeg 4.4
CUDA, Libtorch, cudnn

### Installation
1. clone this repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/symmru/FFmpegSR-ISM2022.git
```
2. Modify the path to libtorch in _CMakeList.txt_ and typt ``cmake .``with CMakeList
3. Then do ``make`` with Makefile (generated by cmakelist not original makefile in repo. It will generate ``libedsr.so``)
4. Replace the home directory in ``install.sh`` and run ``sudo install.sh`` 
5. Clone the ffmpeg rep
```sh
git clone -b release/4.4 https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg
```
6. Copy the ``vf_edsr.c`` to ``FFmpeg/libavfilter`` directory
7. Register the filter with FFmpeg. Add ``extern AVFilter ff_vf_edsr`` to ``libavfilter/allfilters.c``
8. Add ``OBJS-$(CONFIG_EDSR_FILTER) += vf_edsr.o`` to ``libavfilter/Makefile``
9. In the root FFmpeg directory, configure FFmpeg:
```sh
./configure --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --extra-libs='-lstdc++ -ledsr'
```
Please also refer to https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu for further conpilation guide
10. Directly add lib torch PATH into ``~./bashrc``:
```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRART_PATH:/home/lina/libtorch/lib
export PATH=$PATH:/home/lina/libtorch/bin
```
11. make FFmpeg with command ``make``
12. Test with command
```sh
./ffmpeg -benchmark -i path_to_input -filter_complex '
[0:v] format=pix_fmts=yuv420p, extractplanes=y+u+v [y][u][v];
[y] edsr=width=960:height=540:patch_width=160:patch_height=90:scale=2:file_path=path_to_patch_file:model_path=path_to_model [y_scaled];
[u] scale=iw*2:ih*2 [u_scaled];
[v] scale=iw*2:ih*2 [v_scaled];
[y_scaled][u_scaled][v_scaled] mergeplanes=0x001020:yuv420p [merged]
' -map [merged] -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 0 path_to_output
```

In ``edsr`` filter, **width** and **height** stands for the resolution of input video frame. **patch_with** and **patch_height** stands for the resolution of patch frame. Our default setting is 6x6 grid per frame.  **file_path** stands for the patch information that need to apply super resolution. **model_path** is the traced model with ``torchscript``.
